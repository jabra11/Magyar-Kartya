# Magyar Kartya

This game is modelled after the Hungarian cardgame Magyar Kartya. It has a singleplayer and a pure Peer-to-Peer multiplayer. It is written in C++17 and utilizes OpenGL in form of SFML.


To build the game, download the appropriate version of SFML from https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/ (32bit). Set up your compiler as shown in https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-vc.php. Copy the DLL's inside of the downloaded SFML-version/bin folder into your debug and/or release folder inside the solution folder and compile. 
This is soon to be ported to CMake.
